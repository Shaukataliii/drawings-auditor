**📝 Drawing Auditor: Automating the Messy Business of Engineering PDFs**

*Manual drawing audits were eating up days of engineering time—now it's done in minutes. Here’s how I changed the game for one client, and how you can too.*

### 📌 The Problem: Too Many Drawings, Not Enough Time

In many engineering projects, managing technical drawings is a daily headache. Engineers and project managers often juggle hundreds—sometimes thousands—of PDF drawings, trying to match them with Excel-based logs, ensure proper naming conventions, and manually audit inconsistencies. It’s a slow, error-prone process that costs teams time, budget, and focus.

That’s exactly the pain point my client brought to me: “We’re wasting hours every week auditing drawings and still missing key mismatches.” The chaos was real—and costly.

### 🛠 My Solution: A Smart, Seamless Auditor

I built a custom automation system I call **Drawing Auditor**—a Python-based tool designed to do the heavy lifting.

The core idea? Let software do what humans shouldn’t have to:

* **Read Excel files** to extract expected drawing numbers.
* **Scan a folder of engineering PDFs**, use OCR when needed, and match actual contents against the expected list.
* **Automatically sort** each file into *output* or *error* directories based on matching success.

What once required spreadsheets, eye strain, and hours of work now runs with a single command—and finishes in a fraction of the time.

### 💡 How It Works (In Business Terms)

Instead of asking engineers to open each file and verify it manually, the Drawing Auditor:

* Extracts critical identifiers from Excel logs using `pandas`
* Converts each PDF page to an image using `pdf2image`
* Applies OCR where necessary to identify text from scanned drawings
* Automatically copies, renames, and classifies the PDFs into structured directories
* Flags inconsistencies or missing drawings instantly

The result? Zero confusion, no guesswork, and a cleaner, audit-ready archive.

### ⚙️ Real Impact: Time Saved, Accuracy Gained

Before this system, the client’s team was spending up to **3 full working days per audit cycle**. Now, the entire process runs in **under 20 minutes**—with **zero manual oversight**.

Beyond speed, the consistency has improved dramatically. There’s no forgetting a file, no missing typos, no wasted rework. Just clean data, right where it should be.

### 🤝 Why It Matters

Engineering documentation isn’t just paperwork—it’s the blueprint of a project. If your teams are bogged down managing files instead of executing designs, you’re bleeding efficiency.

Whether you're a project manager in construction, an engineer in manufacturing, or running QA in a design consultancy—if you're handling technical drawings at scale, there’s likely room for smart automation.

### 👋 Let’s Talk Possibilities

The Drawing Auditor can be tailored, expanded, or integrated into larger systems. Imagine syncing it with your document management tools, extending it to other document types, or pairing it with real-time dashboards.
